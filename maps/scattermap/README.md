# Simple Regression Residual Mapper
Maps of residuals of simple regressions. Using Seattle data.


A front/(eventually back) end cartography project for an "advanced python" course. 
Turning out to be a mostly JS project, but this is very much a work in progress.

## To do:

- Geopandas w/ pandas file to join csv to spatial dataset.
- above output -> geojson and index.html so one can automate this process. 
- is the legend getting recalculated?
- get more data, clean
- An entire back-end to allow for more datasets? PostgreSQL?
	- http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/databases-leaflet-cartodb/ ?
- Give user option to map x or y variables, and difference between x and y?
