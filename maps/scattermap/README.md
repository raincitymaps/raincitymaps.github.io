# Simple Regression Residual Mapper
Maps of residuals of simple regressions. Using Seattle data.


A front/back end cartography project for an advanced python course. 
Turning out to be a mostly JS project, but this is very much a work in progress.

## To do:
- mouseover datapoint fire mouseover on map and vice versa
    -- do this by giving dots the same .class as leaflet features?
    -- then ideally not use jquery because already heavy.
- legend into standard deviations calculated
- get more data, clean
- have titles for x and y axes of graph and make them prominent 
- make an interface for switching between various datasets for x and y variables -- drop downs?
- the entire back-end
